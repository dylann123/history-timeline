# history timeline

a simple world map

click to plot points onto map

click an existing point to edit a point and delete

switch your year using the little timeline at the bottom

saves points to server, built using the node.js framework with the express.js library

images used are in no way my own - credit where credit is due

this may be the worst code you have ever read - be warned
